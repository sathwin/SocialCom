# SocialCom - Hackathon Submission

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Social anxiety affects 15% of the global population**, making it difficult for people to attend events and make meaningful connections. Traditional event platforms focus on logistics but ignore the emotional barriers that prevent people from showing up.

## 💡 Our Solution

**SocialCom** is an anxiety-friendly social events platform that reduces social barriers through:

1. **Three-Tier Attendee Visibility** - Progressive information disclosure based on commitment level
2. **Anxiety-Friendly Filters** - Find events by noise level, structure, and newcomer-friendliness
3. **Ice Breaker Questions** - Pre-shared conversation starters to reduce awkwardness
4. **Mutual Connections** - See who you know before committing
5. **Clear Expectations** - Know exactly what to expect before you arrive

## 🌟 Key Innovation: Three-Tier Attendee Visibility

Unlike traditional platforms that show all attendees upfront (overwhelming) or none at all (anxiety-inducing), we progressively reveal information:

**Tier 1: Not Logged In**
- See only total attendee count
- Low commitment, low information

**Tier 2: Logged In (No RSVP)**
- See mutual connections attending
- See attendee demographics (first-timers vs regulars)
- Enough info to feel comfortable

**Tier 3: RSVP'd**
- Full attendee list with profiles
- Bios and shared interests
- Enables pre-event connection

This **reduces anxiety while maintaining privacy** - a unique balance.
