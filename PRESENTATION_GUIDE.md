# SocialCom - Hackathon Presentation Guide

## üé§ 2-Minute Pitch

### Hook (15 seconds)
"15% of people have social anxiety. That's 1 in 7 people who want to make friends but are too anxious to attend events. What if we could change that?"

### Problem (30 seconds)
"Traditional event platforms focus on WHAT and WHERE, but ignore the most important question: **Will I feel comfortable?**

People with social anxiety need to know:
- Who's attending?
- What's the vibe?
- Will there be awkward silence?
- Am I the only newcomer?

But showing too much information upfront is overwhelming. It's a catch-22."

### Solution (45 seconds)
"SocialCom solves this with **Three-Tier Attendee Visibility** - a unique privacy system that progressively reveals information based on commitment:

**Tier 1: Browsing** ‚Üí See total attendees
**Tier 2: Interested** ‚Üí See mutual connections & attendee mix
**Tier 3: RSVP'd** ‚Üí Full attendee list with profiles

Plus anxiety-friendly features:
- Filter by noise level
- See event structure (structured vs casual)
- Get ice-breaker questions upfront
- Know who you know before committing

It's like having a friend who's already there, telling you it'll be okay."

### Demo Teaser (20 seconds)
"Let me show you how it works..."

### Close (10 seconds)
"SocialCom makes events accessible to everyone. Because meaningful connections shouldn't be anxiety-inducing."

## ‚ùì Q&A Preparation

### "How is this different from Meetup/Eventbrite?"
"Traditional platforms show logistics. We show **comfort level**. Our three-tier system is unique - you can gauge social safety before committing. Plus filters like noise level and event structure don't exist elsewhere."

### "What about privacy?"
"That's exactly why we built three tiers! Users control their visibility in settings. We respect opt-outs. Tier 1 shows nothing. Tier 2 shows aggregates only. Tier 3 requires mutual commitment (you RSVP'd, they opted in)."

### "How would you monetize?"
"Freemium model:
- Free: Browse, attend, create basic events
- Premium: Verified badge, priority listing, analytics, recurring events
- Enterprise: For companies doing team building
- Commission on paid events"

### "What's next?"
"Phase 2: Real backend (Supabase), auth, messaging
Phase 3: AI recommendations, virtual events, therapy app integrations
Long-term: Global platform for anxiety-friendly socializing"

### "Why should you win?"
"1. Solves real problem affecting 1 in 7 people
2. Novel solution (three-tier visibility)
3. Production quality (not just a prototype)
4. Thoughtful UX throughout
5. Scalable and monetizable
6. Social impact - makes inclusion accessible"
