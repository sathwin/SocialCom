## Mock Data Details

### Events
- 12+ events across 10 categories
- Mix of in-person (Bay Area) and virtual
- Some are almost full to show urgency
- Various dates (2-10 days out)

### Users
- 50 users with realistic bios
- Sarah Chen (you) has 3 connections
- Most users have "show attendance" enabled
- Diverse interests and locations

### Connections
- You're connected to User 2 (Mike Johnson)
- You're connected to User 3 (Alex Rivera)
- You're connected to User 10 (Nina Patel)
- These show up as mutual connections on events

## What's NOT Implemented

Since this is a mock UI:
- No actual authentication (always logged in as Sarah)
- No backend API calls
- No data persistence (refresh resets state)
- No actual file uploads
- No real AI generation
- No email notifications
- No payment processing

## Pages Overview

```
/                     ‚Üí Landing page
/events              ‚Üí Browse with filters
/events/[id]         ‚Üí Event detail (3-tier visibility!)
/events/create       ‚Üí Create event form
/dashboard           ‚Üí User dashboard (4 tabs)
/profile             ‚Üí Profile management
```

## Design Philosophy

Every element is designed to reduce anxiety:
- **Warm colors** (purple/coral vs harsh blues)
- **Soft shadows** (not stark borders)
- **Clear expectations** (badges show structure, noise level)
- **Mutual connections** (social proof)
- **Ice breakers** (conversation help)
- **Flexible cancellation** (low commitment)

## Responsive Behavior

Optimized for desktop (1024px+). Mobile view exists but desktop is recommended for the full experience.

## Need Help?

1. Check the console for any errors
2. Try refreshing if something seems stuck
3. Remember: No data persists between refreshes
4. If server stops: `npm run dev` to restart

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run production build
npm start

# Run linter
npm run lint
```

## Next Steps

1. Explore all pages to see the full experience
2. Try different user flows (RSVP, create, filter)
3. Check out the code structure
4. Read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md for technical details
5. Customize colors in tailwind.config.ts
6. Add more mock data in lib/mockData.ts

Enjoy exploring! üéâ
